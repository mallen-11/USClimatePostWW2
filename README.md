# USClimatePostWW2
With Earth Day coming up, this is a graph showing the rising climate in the US from 1946-2013.

All data is from https://www.kaggle.com/berkeleyearth/climate-change-earth-surface-temperature-data

Data Visualization is key to understanding complex ideas that happen over a long period of time. Since WW2, the US has seen an unprecidented rise in temperature that has destroyed millions of acres of natural land. We are constantly reminded by this as more and more natural disasters are occuring. This graph shows an increase in about 1 degree Celsius in the US since 1946. It is important we can visualize this data because it gives a greater meaning then just lines on a piece of paper. 

We can all support our environment by planting more trees, being more energy efficient, picking up trash, walking or biking instead of driving of a car, and most of all switching to renewable energy resources such as wind, solar, and hydropower. I challenge everyone to take a step in the right direction this Earth Day.
